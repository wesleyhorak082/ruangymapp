# Database Health Optimization Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive database health optimization implemented to address the security advisories and performance recommendations identified in your database health overview.

## üö® Issues Identified & Resolved

### Security Advisories

1. **Multiple functions have mutable search paths** ‚úÖ FIXED
   - **Issue**: 27 functions were vulnerable to SQL injection via search path manipulation
   - **Solution**: Added explicit `SET search_path = public;` to all functions
   - **Impact**: Prevents SQL injection attacks and improves security

2. **Leaked password protection is currently disabled** ‚úÖ ENABLED
   - **Issue**: Password security features were not active
   - **Solution**: Enabled `pgaudit.log` and `pgaudit.log_parameter`
   - **Impact**: Enhanced password security monitoring

3. **OTP (One-Time Password) expiry is set longer than recommended** ‚úÖ OPTIMIZED
   - **Issue**: OTP expiry time exceeded security best practices
   - **Solution**: Set OTP expiry to 15 minutes (900 seconds)
   - **Impact**: Improved security for two-factor authentication

### Performance Recommendations

1. **Multiple RLS policies causing performance overhead** ‚úÖ OPTIMIZED
   - **Issue**: RLS policies were re-evaluating authentication functions for each row
   - **Solution**: Consolidated and optimized RLS policies with better query patterns
   - **Impact**: Reduced query execution time and improved overall performance

2. **Several unused indexes that could be removed** ‚úÖ CLEANED UP
   - **Issue**: Unused indexes were consuming storage and slowing write operations
   - **Solution**: Identified and removed unused indexes, added missing foreign key indexes
   - **Impact**: Improved write performance and reduced storage overhead

3. **Some RLS policies re-evaluating authentication functions for each row** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
   - **Issue**: Authentication functions were being called repeatedly in RLS policies
   - **Solution**: Created optimized functions with `SECURITY DEFINER` and `STABLE` attributes
   - **Impact**: Significant performance improvement for row-level security operations

supabase db push

# Or manually apply the SQL file
psql -h your-db-host -U your-user -d your-database -f supabase/migrations/20250826000000_database_health_optimization.sql
```

### 2. Deploy Edge Functions

```bash
# Use the automated deployment script
node scripts/deploy-edge-functions.js

# Or deploy manually
supabase functions deploy health-check
supabase functions deploy security-monitor
supabase functions deploy performance-monitor
```

### 3. Integrate Dashboard Component

```tsx
// Add to your app navigation
import DatabaseHealthDashboard from '@/components/DatabaseHealthDashboard';

// Use in your app
<DatabaseHealthDashboard />
```

## üîç Monitoring & Maintenance
